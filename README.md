## Description

Historically, many methods have been created to assist with studying and memorization. Among these methods, some of the most powerful are using flashcards and social forums! We created this expansion to the [Study Buddy](https://github.com/ssnakeoil/the-study-buddy) to help students who wish to study in a group setting but do not have the means to get together by providing a virtual venue for discussion and debate. When users are stuck on a problem--no problem--they can go to their buddy Brain Storm's page where they can ask a question and other registered users can comment ideas and answers! Users will now also have access to a flashcard generator and can make their own study cards as a personal study tool, assisted by their other buddy Flash! In addition, we've included a live chat feature that can connect students with their teacher for real time answers.

It may seem like a fairly simple flashcard app on the surface, but it includes some advanced features that are helpful for ensuring that youâ€™ve learned information thoroughly; and how can you get bored when you have all your awesome buddies to interact with? But that's not all, there is an amazing new feature, which is the introduction of a chat, where the user can now message an Admin/teacher/tutor live if both users are online! In future iterations, we hope to add the first original buddy, Quiz Wiz, but that will have to wait until he graduates wizarding school! He will be reunited with his friends, new and improved.

We dream to add more and more buddies and features to make studying and learning more effective but still fun... stay tuned!
