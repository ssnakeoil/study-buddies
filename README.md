# Study Buddies

## Description
This is a further expansion on the Study Buddy! Now with new friends! This is a social study experience made for those who wish to study in a group setting but do not have the means to get together in a class. Meant to be used by students in a classroom and with a teacher as an admin. In this this application, users will now have access to a flashcard generator and can make their own study cards as a personal study tool, assisted by the new buddy Flash! When users are stuck on a problem, no problem, they can go to another buddy named Brain Storm where they can ask a question and other registered users can comment ideas and answers! The final new feature is the introduction to a chat, where the user can now message an Admin/teacher/tutor live if both users are online! Future prospects hopes to add the first original buddy, in his new design, Quiz Wiz! He will be added in the future and reunited with his team new and improved! Future development hopes to add more buddies and features to make studying and learning a fun experience.
