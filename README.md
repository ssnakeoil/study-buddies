# Study Buddies

## Description
To make memorization and studying easier, people have come up with all kinds of systems and techniques. One of the most powerful techniques is flashcards. So we created this app, which is a further expansion on the Study Buddy! Now with new friends! This app is designed to help students study in a large social virtual group with a teacher as an admin.In this application, users will have access to a flashcard generator and can make their own study cards as a personal study tool, assisted by the new buddy Flash! When users are stuck on a problem, no problem, they can go to another buddy named Brain Storm where they can ask a question and other registered users can comment ideas and answers! Seems like a fairly simple flashcard app on the surface, but it includes some advanced features that are helpful for  ensuring that youâ€™ve learned information thoroughly, and still never get bored by interacting with all the awesome buddies . But this not everything, there is our amazing new feature, which is the introduction to a chat, where the user can now message an Admin/teacher/tutor live if both users are online! And for our Future prospects, we hope to add the first original buddy, in his new design, Quiz Wiz! He will be added in the future and reunited with his team, new and improved.
In addition, we dream to add more and more buddies and features to make studying and learning more effective but still fun.
